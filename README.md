# GroupFinder

GroupFinder is an application designed to facilitate the formation of study groups among students. This README provides instructions on how to set up and run the GroupFinder project locally.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Git
- Node.js and npm

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmedbashir10/GroupFinder.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd GroupFinder/native
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary Node.js dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npm install react-native-dotenv
```

### 4. Start the Application

Launch the application with:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the Metro Bundler, which compiles the JavaScript code and serves it to your application.

### 5. Running on a Device or Emulator

To run the application on a physical device or an emulator, follow the instructions provided by the Metro Bundler terminal window. Typically, this involves scanning a QR code with the Expo app (for physical devices) or pressing a specific key to launch an emulator.

## Additional Setup

Ensure you have an `.env` file in the `native` directory with the necessary Firebase configuration. The `.env` file should contain the following environment variables (replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase configuration):

```
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
```

**Note:** For security reasons, do not commit the `.env` file to public repositories.
